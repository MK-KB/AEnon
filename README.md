<h2>Misc.</h2>
<p>This unit was produced by DDS (Shenzhen Dadesin Prototype) in 07/2022 for $610 excluding shipping. There are for sure some cheaper alternatives out there but I didnâ€™t feel like taking the risk. Even with DDS there were issues that occurred during manufacturing and shipping.</p> 
<p>The case was designed around Mechlovin' Infinity 87.5 1.2mm pcb and with ANSI plate only as I don't use ISO.</p>
